# Gest of my journey lvl 1

When I began my journey in DevOps, I was not familiar with the various technologies, practices, and tools that define this dynamic field. However, through dedicated learning, practical experience, and a systematic approach, I have developed a strong proficiency in numerous DevOps tools and methodologies. This document outlines my journey, detailing my starting point, progression, and future aspirations.

### Git & Version Control: The Foundation of Collaboration

Initially, my understanding of Git was basic, and I did not fully appreciate its capabilities in a collaborative environment. Gradually, I learned how Git facilitates efficient version control, collaboration, and parallel development workflows. I also became proficient in using platforms like GitHub to manage pull requests, resolve merge conflicts, and conduct code reviews.

- Key Learnings:
  - Fundamental Git commands (commit, push, pull, stack, fetch etc.).
  - Branching and merging strategies (e.g., GitFlow).
  - Collaboration through pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking on GitHub.

Through collaboration and contributions to open-source projects, I now recognize the significance of using Git to maintain a clean, organized, and scalable codebase.

### Docker & Containers: Simplifying Development and Deployment

Before I learned about containers, I faced challenges in maintaining consistency across development, testing, and production environments. The introduction of Docker transformed my approach. I quickly realized that Docker offers an isolated and consistent environment, allowing developers to run applications without concerns about dependencies or platform discrepancies.

- Key Learnings:
  - Building Docker images and managing containers.
  - Writing Dockerfiles to automate image creation.
  - Utilizing Docker Compose for multi-container applications.
  - Advantages of containers: portability, scalability, and environmental consistency.

### Kubernetes: Orchestrating Containers at Scale

While Docker revolutionized containerization, managing containers at scale across multiple nodes was initially intimidating. This is where Kubernetes became essential. Through hands-on labs and tutorials, I learned how Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containers.

- Key Learnings:
  - Understanding Kubernetes architecture: Pods, Services, Deployments, and Namespaces.
  - Setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters.
  - Implementing automated scaling and rolling updates of services.
  - Exposing services using Ingress Controllers.

I now feel confident in using Kubernetes to deploy and scale containerized applications in cloud environments.

### CI/CD: Automating the Software Delivery Pipeline

At first, I underestimated the importance of CI/CD pipelines for automating the testing, building, and deployment of applications. Once I grasped the concepts, I recognized how they accelerate the development lifecycle while reducing human error.

- Key Learnings:
  - Continuous Integration (CI): Automating code testing and integration into the codebase.
  - Continuous Delivery (CD): Automatically deploying applications to staging/production environments after successful tests.
  - Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Travis CI.
  - Deployment strategies: blue-green, canary releases, feature flags.

I have implemented pipelines that automatically test and deploy code changes to production, ensuring faster releases and improved code quality.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automating Cloud Infrastructure

Initially, the concept of managing infrastructure through code was unfamiliar to me. However, after learning tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation, I now understand how IaC enhances the reliability and reproducibility of infrastructure provisioning.

- Key Learnings:
  - Writing Terraform scripts to provision cloud infrastructure (e.g., VPCs, EC2 instances).
  - Managing infrastructure resources using version-controlled code.
  - Benefits: reproducibility, scalability, and consistency.

This knowledge has empowered me to build, test, and manage entire cloud environments using straightforward scripts.

### Managed Kubernetes Services: Simplifying Cluster Management

While setting up Kubernetes manually is one aspect, managing it at scale presents its own challenges. Learning about managed Kubernetes services such as AWS EKS, Azure AKS, and Google GKE has simplified cluster management. These services alleviate much of the operational burden, allowing me to concentrate on deploying and scaling applications.

- Key Learnings:
  - Provisioning and configuring clusters using EKS, AKS, and GKE.
  - Automating updates and scaling in a managed Kubernetes environment.


---

### Cloud-Native & Serverless Computing: Scaling Without the Overhead

Cloud-native DevOps leverages cloud capabilities for scalable, flexible, and cost-effective deployments. Through my studies, I have gained insights into how serverless computing—such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions—enables the development of scalable applications with minimal infrastructure management.

- Key Learnings:
  - Understanding serverless architectures: utilizing cloud services to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
  - Benefits: reduced costs, scalability, and event-driven design.

I am now confident in building applications that automatically scale without the need for server management.

## Inspirations

Learning these concepts and tools inspired me to share my learning while using them so that it can act as a guideline for others out there starting to learn DevOps.

In the span of this course I wrote multiple blogs and guidlines a few mentioned below:

### [Blog1](https://medium.com/@twitchingfarjad/unleashing-the-speed-of-teradata-vantage-architecture-features-and-why-its-fast-a6fc5a7bc228)

In today’s data-driven world, speed is everything. Organizations demand fast, efficient, and scalable solutions for storing and retrieving vast amounts of data. Enter Teradata Vantage — an advanced data analytics platform designed for high-speed data management. But what makes Teradata Vantage faster than traditional database systems? The answer lies in its architecture, intelligent memory management, and optimized data retrieval methods.

### [Blog2](https://medium.com/@twitchingfarjad/setting-up-aws-eks-with-terraform-a-step-by-step-guide-for-developers-by-developer-9655f38b8f85)

An effective technique to orchestrate containers in the cloud is to deploy Kubernetes clusters on AWS using EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables a more scalable, repeatable, and version-controlled method of deploying your clusters than the AWS Management Console, which is a graphical user interface.
In this blog, we’ll use Terraform to provide and configure an EKS cluster, explaining why each configuration is required along the way. Let’s explore the technical details in detail using pictures, recommended practices, and actual code snippets.

### [Blog3](https://medium.com/@twitchingfarjad/a-guide-to-setting-up-github-actions-for-a-suitecrm-php-product-38e856005f75)

This guide assumes you have some technical knowledge of PHP, GitHub repositories, and CI/CD concepts. If you’re developing a SuiteCRM PHP product, GitHub Actions can be a powerful tool to automate testing, code quality checks, and deployment processes. In this guide, we’ll explore how to structure your repository, set up GitHub Actions, and integrate it with SuiteCRM development workflows.



## Conclusion

From my initial lack of understanding of DevOps practices, I have developed expertise in key technologies such as Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, IaC, and DevSecOps. Throughout this journey, I have not only learned to streamline development and deployment pipelines but also integrated security at every step, making DevSecOps a core aspect of my practice.

With a solid understanding of DevSecOps principles, I am now prepared to:
- Securely build, deploy, and manage containerized applications.
- Implement robust CI/CD pipelines that include automated security checks.
- Manage infrastructure using Terraform and Kubernetes while adhering to security best practices.
- Integrate security as code into my development and deployment workflows.
